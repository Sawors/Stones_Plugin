This is a very basic introduction on how to write music sheets for the plugin.

the main source of information is the wiki : https://github.com/Sawors/Stones_Plugin/wiki




notes :
    In Minecraft, a Noteblock can have 25 different pitches (how high a note is).
    Here, each pitch value a vanilla Noteblock has is translated in a letter

    in "clicks" on the noteblock (pitch):
        a->y = 0->24 click(s)
        z = stop (almost useless, the music stops automatically at the end of the sheet anyway)

    to make "blank" notes, or recreate repeater delay, you can use 0 to mark 1 repeater tick
        0 = 1 repeater tick


    a finished song looks like this :
